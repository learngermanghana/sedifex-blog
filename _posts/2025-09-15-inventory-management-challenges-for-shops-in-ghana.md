## Inventory Management in Ghana: A Daily Struggle

Across Ghana, many shops still manage inventory using notebooks, memory, or basic spreadsheets.  
While these methods may work at the beginning, they quickly become difficult to maintain as businesses grow.

Missing stock, pricing mistakes, and unclear sales records are common challenges that affect daily operations.

## Common Challenges Faced by Shops in Ghana

### 1. Manual Stock Tracking
Many shop owners rely on handwritten records to track inventory.  
This often leads to:
- inaccurate stock counts,
- forgotten updates,
- and difficulty knowing which products are selling fast.

### 2. Disconnected Sales and Inventory
In many shops, sales are recorded separately from inventory.  
When these systems are not connected, stock levels do not update automatically, creating confusion and errors.

### 3. Lost or Unclear Receipts
Handwritten receipts can easily be misplaced or damaged.  
Customers may return without proof of purchase, and businesses struggle to verify transactions.

### 4. Limited Business Visibility
Without a clear dashboard, shop owners cannot easily see:
- daily sales totals,
- remaining stock,
- or overall performance.

This makes planning and decision-making harder.

## Why These Challenges Slow Business Growth

When inventory management is unclear:
- time is wasted correcting mistakes,
- customers lose confidence,
- and profits become harder to track.

For growing shops in Accra and across Ghana, these small problems quickly add up.
