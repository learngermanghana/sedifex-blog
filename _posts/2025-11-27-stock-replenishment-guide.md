Keeping shelves full is hard when you rely on memory or scattered notebooks.
Sedifex tracks products, highlights reorder points, and lets you restock based
on real movement instead of guesses. This playbook shows how store owners and
managers use it day to day.

## 1) Start with clean product data

- Add every SKU with clear names customers recognise.
- Capture cost price, selling price, and supplier for each item.
- Mark variants (sizes, colours) so you do not double count stock.

## 2) Watch the fast movers

On the **Activity** page, filter by product to see what sold in the last week.
Tag your top movers and check they never drop below two to three days of
expected sales.

## 3) Set a simple reorder rule

Use a minimum quantity that equals **average daily sales x 3 days**. Example: if
bottled water sells 10 packs per day, set the threshold at 30. Sedifex will flag
when you go below that number.

## 4) Replenish with evidence

Export your products list with current stock and send it to suppliers. Because
Sedifex stores the last purchase price and supplier name, you avoid ordering
from memory or paying old prices.

## 5) After delivery, update quickly

Record the incoming stock immediately after counting. If something is missing or
short-dated, add a quick note. These notes are visible later when expenses feel
out of line.

## 6) Review weekly

Spend 10 minutes each Monday checking two things:

1. Items that dropped below the reorder point more than once.
2. Products that did not sell for two weeks — consider smaller quantities or
   promos.

Consistent execution beats complicated maths. With Sedifex keeping the numbers,
you can focus on negotiating better prices and moving inventory faster.
