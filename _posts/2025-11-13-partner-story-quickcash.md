QuickCash Courier handles same-day deliveries for shops in Accra. They partnered
with Sedifex to give merchants better visibility into delivery costs and
customer experience. Together we built a simple workflow that both sides can
maintain without extra tools.

## Why the partnership mattered

- Merchants wanted **proof of delivery** without waiting for riders to return.
- Couriers needed a **fast way to log cash collections** for cash-on-delivery
  orders.
- Everyone wanted **fewer disputes** about missing items.

## The joint workflow

1. **Order export:** Merchants export orders from Sedifex with customer phone and
   payment type.
2. **Courier intake:** QuickCash imports the CSV, assigns riders, and adds the
   job codes back into Sedifex as references.
3. **Proof and payment:** Riders share a photo or signature; the dispatcher logs
   the delivery status and cash amount directly into Sedifex via a shared login.
4. **Daily reconciliation:** At close of day, Sedifex shows cash collected per
   rider and flags any mismatch between expected and delivered items.

## Benefits after one month

- **Faster reconciliation**: Finance teams close out deliveries the same day.
- **Higher trust**: Merchants see timestamps and rider notes without calling the
  dispatch centre.
- **Better customer service**: Failed deliveries are tagged with reasons, so
  shops can follow up with buyers instead of guessing.

> "Sedifex makes delivery data part of the sales record instead of a separate
> spreadsheet. That keeps everyone honest and speeds up payment cycles."

## What is next

We are expanding the workflow with **SMS status updates** and **pre-printed
labels** that include the Sedifex job code. The goal is to keep the process
lightweight while giving both merchants and couriers reliable records.
