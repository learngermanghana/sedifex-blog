## Don’t know your level? Start here
One of the biggest problems learners face is simple:

You want to learn a language, but you’re not sure if you should start at **A1, A2, B1, B2, or C1**.

Starting too low feels boring.  
Starting too high feels frustrating.

That’s why we created a new **Placement Test page** on Falowen.

👉 Take the placement test here: **https://www.falowen.app/placement-test**

## What the Placement Test helps you do
The placement test is made for learners who want clarity.

It helps you:
- estimate your current CEFR level
- avoid guessing and wasting time
- choose the right course path inside Falowen
- study with more confidence from day one

## Who should use it?
Use the placement test if:
- you learned before but stopped
- you’re self-taught and never took an official course
- you don’t know where you fit in CEFR levels
- you want to join a class or prepare for an exam and need direction

## After the test: what’s next?
Once you get your estimated level, you can:
- start the matching Falowen course
- build a daily routine
- track progress and improve consistently
