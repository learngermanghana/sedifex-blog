When a family-run mini-mart in Kumasi moved from paper notebooks to Sedifex,
they discovered that their best-selling products were often out of stock on
Fridays, and that half of all returns came from three SKUs. The team used these
insights to reshape ordering and staffing.

## Starting point

- **3 staff** rotating between till, shelf arrangement, and deliveries.
- **Paper receipts** that were hard to search and often misplaced.
- Stock-outs on popular drinks every weekend.

## What they changed with Sedifex

1. **Digitised sales**: Every sale now goes into Sedifex with payment method and
   customer notes.
2. **Expense tracking**: Delivery costs, repairs, and one-off purchases are now
   tagged, so the owner sees weekly totals.
3. **Activity dashboard**: The owner checks the feed every evening from home,
   spotting late restocks or unusual voided sales.

## Results after six weeks

- **10% revenue lift** from never running out of fast-moving drinks on Fridays.
- **Fewer returns** after replacing the three problematic SKUs.
- **Clearer margins** because delivery fuel costs are now allocated per route.

> "Sedifex made it easy to see what we should stop stocking and what to buy more
> of. We plan for weekends instead of reacting to problems." — Store owner

## How they run today

- A short **replenishment checklist** every Thursday.
- **Daily sales summary** shared with the owner and the staff group chat.
- **Monthly supplier review** using Sedifex export to compare prices.

For small shops, discipline beats complexity. This case study shows how simple
habits plus readable data can change the weekend rush.
