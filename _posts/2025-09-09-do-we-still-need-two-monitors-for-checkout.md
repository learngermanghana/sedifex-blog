## The Traditional Way

For years, many retail shops have relied on two monitors at checkout.  
One screen faces the seller to manage products and payments, while the second screen faces the customer to show items, prices, and totals in real time.

This setup became the standard because it builds trust and transparency. Customers can see exactly what is being added and how the total is calculated.

However, traditional dual-monitor systems come with challenges. Extra screens cost money, require cables and desk space, and are often impractical for small shops, kiosks, mobile sellers, and pop-up businesses.

## The Reality of Modern Retail

Today, most people already own multiple screens.  
Phones, tablets, and spare devices are everywhere—often sitting unused in shops and homes.

Sedifex Inventory App was designed around this reality. Instead of forcing businesses to buy additional hardware, Sedifex makes use of devices they already have.

## How Sedifex Simplifies Checkout

Sedifex includes a built-in **Customer Display** feature that replaces the traditional second monitor.

With a single click on the Sell page, Sedifex generates a customer display link and QR code. That link can be opened instantly on a phone, tablet, or second screen to show a live view of the checkout.

As the seller scans items or adds products:
- Items appear instantly on the customer display  
- Subtotals, tax, discounts, and totals update live  
- Customers can follow the sale step by step  

After payment, the display can show a receipt link or QR code for easy sharing.

## Flexible Setup for Any Business

Sedifex adapts to different shop environments without forcing a fixed setup.

- **Laptop + Tablet**  
  A professional counter setup with a tablet facing the customer.

- **Laptop + Phone**  
  An old phone becomes a second screen, saving hardware costs.

- **Two Monitors**  
  Shops that already have two screens can still use Sedifex in full-screen display mode.

- **Customer’s Phone**  
  Customers scan a QR code and view their cart directly on their own device—ideal for small spaces and mobile sellers.

This flexibility allows businesses to scale without changing how they work.

## Why Visibility at Checkout Matters

When customers see their totals clearly, trust improves.  
Misunderstandings reduce, checkout becomes faster, and staff spend less time answering price-related questions.

Sedifex delivers the same transparent checkout experience used by large retailers, but in a way that is accessible to small and growing businesses.

## Do We Still Need Two Monitors?

Not necessarily.

If you already use two monitors, Sedifex works seamlessly with them.  
If you do not, Sedifex gives you the same result using devices you already own.

That simplicity is what makes Sedifex practical for modern retail—whether you run a kiosk, boutique, pharmacy, supermarket, or mobile business.

## Final Thoughts

Checkout should be clear, affordable, and easy to set up.  
Sedifex modernizes the traditional two-screen experience by making it flexible and device-friendly.

Instead of investing in extra hardware, businesses can focus on what matters most: serving customers efficiently and professionally.
