Growing shops often add a second location before they hire more back-office
help. Sedifex keeps both branches in sync so the owner sees combined numbers
without creating a new system.

## Create clear location names

Use branch names customers know: **Adum**, **East Legon**, **Tamale Central**. The
names flow into reports and make it easy to compare performance.

## Standardise the catalog first

- Use the **same product list** for every branch so sales and stock stay
  comparable.
- Avoid branch-specific pricing unless there is a clear cost difference.
- Add service items (repairs, delivery fees) to the catalog to keep revenue data
  consistent.

## Daily operations by branch

- Staff log sales under their branch login, so the activity feed remains clean.
- Expenses are tagged by branch (e.g., "East Legon - Generator fuel").
- Managers check **branch dashboards** to see who is keeping up with restocking
  and expense entries.

## Weekly roll-up for the owner

1. Open the **combined sales report** to see overall revenue.
2. Compare **top products** across branches; move inventory from slow to fast
   locations.
3. Review **expenses per branch** to spot unusual spikes.

## When to split inventory

If branches start stocking different assortments, create a **branch attribute**
for each product that varies. Sedifex will show branch-specific quantities while
still keeping a shared product ID.

The goal is simple: let each branch act independently during the day, while the
owner sees one clear picture at night.
