Sedifex AI is more than a report generator. It reviews daily performance,
predicts where you might lose revenue, and suggests concrete actions for the
next shift.

## The 30-second briefing

After each day closes, the AI summarises:

- Best-selling products and whether they are trending up or down.
- Customers who bought twice in the week (ideal for loyalty offers).
- Expenses that spiked compared to last week.

Store managers read this briefing before morning huddles, turning it into a
simple plan: what to restock, who to call, and where to cut unnecessary spend.

## Spotting revenue leaks

Sedifex flags patterns that hint at lost revenue:

- Many voided sales on one register.
- Cash-only purchases in areas where MoMo is common.
- Items that repeatedly go out of stock on the same day of the week.

## Suggested actions you can trust

Every suggestion includes the data that triggered it. If AI recommends buying
more of a product, it shows the last seven days of demand and current stock
position. That transparency helps managers act quickly without second-guessing
why the alert appeared.

## Getting started

- Keep your product list clean so AI can recognise patterns.
- Enter expenses daily — otherwise profitability insights are incomplete.
- Encourage staff to add short customer notes; loyalty prompts become smarter.

With Sedifex acting like a calm sales coach, teams spend less time debating and
more time executing.
